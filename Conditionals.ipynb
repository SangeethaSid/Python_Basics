A program does not only execute instructions line by line, it may need to repeat, skip or select instructions based on conditions. Simple examples would be \"select customers whose income is greater than 100K\", or \"keep checking the username and password until they are correct\". Flow control statements in Python will help your program to decide how the instructions are executed.<br>\n",
